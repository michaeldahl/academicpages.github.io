What does it mean, when seminar participants or journal referees claim that your paper has an endogeneity problem or an unclear identification strategy? How can you deal with these challenges? With a point of departure in the ideal randomized experiments, this PhD course introduces a tool-box with various techniques to deal with these questions in quantitative analysis of non-experimental data. This course will present and discuss state-of-the-art quantitative empirical methods in management with a focus on application and understanding the underlying intuition.

*My colleague, Professor John Th√∏gersen, teaches a section on structural equation models as part of this course.*

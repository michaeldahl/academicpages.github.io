## Entrepreneurial Couples

*with Mirjam van Praag and Peter Thompson*

We study motivations for and outcomes of couples starting up a joint firm, using a sample of 1,069 Danish couples that established a joint enterprise between 2001 and 2010, while comparing them to a set of comparable firms and couples. The main motivation for joint entrepreneurship is to create a labor market position for (female) spouses with limited alternative opportunities. This decision has positive effects: the financial benefits for each of the spouses, and especially the female, are larger in co-entrepreneurial firms, both during the life of the business and post-dissolution. This also reduces income inequality in the household.

## Pay-for-Performance and Employee Mental Health: Large Sample Evidence Using Employee Prescription Drug Usage

*with Lamar Pierce*

This paper provides the first evidence linking pay-for-performance (P4P) adoption by employers to mental health problems in employees. Linking survey-based data on P4P adoption by 1,419 Danish firms with objective wage, demographic, and medical prescription data of their 379,936 full-time employees, we find a five percent increase in the usage of anti-depressant and anti-anxiety after firms adopt P4P. This change does not appear related to decreased wages, and is observed almost exclusively in men and those older than fifty. We find no evidence of increased turnover. Although we cannot claim a causal relationship, collectively our results support prior theoretical arguments that performance-based pay may indeed increase stress in ways necessitating medical treatment.
